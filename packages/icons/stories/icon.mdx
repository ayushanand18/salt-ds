# Icon

Icon is an important visual representation of an application, a capability, or some other concept or specific entity with meaning on a interface. Icons help users to recognize and understand a concept or an action regardless of linguistic or cultural boundaries.

If an icon is interactive, use [Button](?path=/docs/documentation-core-button--page) (`CTA`, `Primary` or `Secondary` variant).

## Use Icon when...

- You need a visual representation of a concept.
- An icon doesn't need to be interactive.

## Features

We have a default icon set that starts from 12px for high and medium density (MD), then 14px for low density (LD), and 16px for touch density (TD). (Since our base size of high density (HD)/default is 10px but we don’t allow icons size smaller than 12px. The HD/default will start from 12px, and its 2X is 20px, 3X is 30px and onwards through the multiples)
You have more size choices by adding multiplies to 2x, 3x, 4x and onwards.

We provide two types of icons: default and solid. Most of our icons will have the two versions, except cases in which the icon shape is too narrow to have a solid version like `plus` and `loader`.

To override the default color of the icon, you can use the `--saltIcon-color` CSS variable.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={IconStories.ColorOverride} />
</Canvas>

If you need a custom SVG icon you can use the `Icon` component. `Icon` has the same API as the native `<svg>` element. Whenever you add a custom icon you need to pass an `aria-label` to the Icon.

## Accessibility

Decorative icons (icons that repeat the information already expressed by the accompanied text) should be hidden from the screen reader to avoid repetition.
If you are adding an icon for decorative purposes, pass `aria-hidden=”true”` to hide its label from the screen reader.
