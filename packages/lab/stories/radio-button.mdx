# RadioButton

A group of Radio Button components represents a set of mutually exclusive, but related values. The user is able to select a single value at a time, and selecting an unselected value deselect any previously-selected option. Radio Buttons should therefore be used to display a choice between two or more values, as it’s impossible to deselect a single Radio Button once it’s been selected.

## Vertical Group

Radio groups allow selection of one or more values from a given set of choices. They can be aligned horizontally or vertically.

**Best practices**

- Always use a label for Radio Groups.
- If there are more than 5 choices, use a Multiselect control instead.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={RadioButtonStories.VerticalGroup} />
</Canvas>

## Row Group

<Canvas>
  <Story of={RadioButtonStories.RowGroup} />
</Canvas>

## Controlled

Controlled Radio require events to trigger the state change. The application must track state and update Radio props manually. Useful for when logic or validation needs to be applied or a request should happen when updating a form.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={RadioButtonStories.ControlledRadioButtonGroup} />
</Canvas>

## Custom Icons

<Canvas>
  <Story of={RadioButtonStories.CustomIcons} />
</Canvas>

## Long Text

When the text label wraps to multiple lines, align the text to the top.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={RadioButtonStories.LongTextRadioButtonGroup} />
</Canvas>
