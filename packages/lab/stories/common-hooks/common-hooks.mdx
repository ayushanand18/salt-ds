# Common Collection Hooks

This suite of hooks provide support for Components that present collections of data items - for example List and Tree. Such components share common behaviours such as keyboard navigation, item selection, searching and filtering. These common hooks allow such behaviour to be shared across components, reducing overall code size and helping to enforce consistent APIs.

# useCollectionItems

This hook manages a collection of Items, for components such as:

- List
- ComboBox
- Dropdown
- Tree
