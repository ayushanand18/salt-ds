# Layer layout

The Layer layout defines a layer above the existing layout structure for UI elements to be displayed in.

It can be used to build dialog or drawer components and it can be positioned in different parts of the screen.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={LayerLayoutStories.Default} />
</Canvas>

## Use Layer layout when...

You need your content to be displayed in a specific area of the screen.

Use this component by passing your content as children. You may also choose to control the opening/closing behavior using something like a button.

The Layer layout displays a scrim and animations by default but you can disable these via props. The `fullScreenAtBreakpoint` prop also allows you to customize the breakpoint at which the layer will take up the whole screen.

### Don't use Layer layout when...

Instead you want your content to be split between pages or tabs. In this case we recommend you having a look at [Deck layout](?path=/docs/documentation-lab-layout-deck-layout--page).

### Examples

#### Layer positioning

The component will be displayed in the center position by default but you can customize this via the `position` prop as per the following examples.

##### Top positioned

<Canvas>
  <Story of={LayerLayoutStories.Top} />
</Canvas>

##### Right positioned

<Canvas>
  <Story of={LayerLayoutStories.Right} />
</Canvas>

##### Left positioned

<Canvas>
  <Story of={LayerLayoutStories.Left} />
</Canvas>

##### Bottom positioned

<Canvas>
  <Story of={LayerLayoutStories.Bottom} />
</Canvas>

#### Reduced motion

You can customize or disable the animations using the `prefers-reduced-motion` CSS media feature.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={LayerLayoutStories.ReducedMotion} />
</Canvas>
